    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <hr />
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Maarten, a dedicated and service-oriented support engineer with over three years of experience in
      IT. Throughout my career, I’ve built a reputation for being flexible, communicative, and solution-driven. My
      strong analytical skills and proactive mindset help me approach challenges with confidence and deliver effective
      results.
    </p>

    <p>I hold several industry-recognized certifications, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AZ-104</li>
      <li>AZ-900</li>
      <li>MS-900</li>
      <li>MD-100</li>
      <li>MOS-Outlook</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These reflect my commitment to continuously expanding my technical knowledge. These certifications, combined with
      hands-on experience in support engineering and onsite support, have allowed me to tackle complex technical
      problems while maintaining a professional and calm approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m passionate about bouldering, golf, gaming, festivals, and exploring museums. I also enjoy
      keeping up with the latest advancements in technology and am always eager to learn. Currently, I’m taking a Web
      Development Bootcamp to further broaden my expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thrive in team environments and love a good challenge. Whether it’s solving a tough IT issue or collaborating on
      a new project, I’m always ready to dive in and make a difference.
